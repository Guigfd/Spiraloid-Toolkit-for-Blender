# Spiraloid-Toolkit-for-Blender
misc Blender utilities

Unless stated otherwise, many of these scripts and addons are a collaboration of others from the blender open source community.
I am posting the python scripts here because as I have updated or modified the code to work with blender 2.79 and suit my own workflows.   
I am merely standing on the shoulders of others.  
I try to reference the original authors and link to forum posts or webpages as I can in the history.  
Any concerns, feel free to contact me and I can adjust.  Just want to share as I get with other awesome blender users.

cheers.
